Or not. we've had bad luck so far\r\nHe's gonna look at the amulet, figure some shit\r\n\r\nWilbur: 9ft tall, poor, not wearing a hat\r\n\r\nGoing to mayors: We need a permit\r\nurchin kid: dindu nuffin. DEFINITELY a loser. fuck that kid.\r\nWe get a permit BUT ITs A FUGAZI\r\noh yeah the password to the boarded up place is NOT \"FUCK\"\r\n\r\nOK Try again tomorrow- Matay decides to \"go to town\" (aka fuck or w/e)\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day we go to the same guards and hand them the same ticket LIKE THATS GONNA WORK FUCK\r\n\r\nValmyr or whatever magic shit puts them together and I \"suggest\" that the other guards on the west gate let us in\r\n\r\nAlso matay saves his own skin by giving the other guard a quickie\r\n\r\nwe walk in, i smooth talk some more, we see the mayor, he tells us to go to some bumfuck town down the river (portsmouth? pottymouth? idk)\r\n\r\nThen he shoos us out so he can talk to the shadow goverment (LITERALLY FUCKING SHADOWS) and forces us into the sewers where MORE FUCKING CULTISTS? SERIOUSLY\r\n\r\nMatay saw something that made him cry, but he still did ok against the cultists. Dave and Ulfjizz made stew with their weapons. I hope the Health & Safety guys don't come down here.\r\n\r\nWe ended up outside the city gates in the end. We will have to decide whether to go back in or head down the river. I literally don't care, they will still find me. \r\n",
