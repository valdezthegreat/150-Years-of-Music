<p>Recap:
We got fucked in a library and met whats his dick (armitits) and then got attacked by cultists while going to see some other dood</p>

<p>Loot:
Wooden amulet tied with twine with blackened burned in image of a sheep.</p>

<p>Professor Die-er: came back half-crazed with a grad student. maybe they fucked.
He's a geologist, doesnt SEEM to know anything. he's holding shit back</p>

<p>Wilmarth: Prof, dept of history He could tell us more about this amulet thingy. Or not. we've had bad luck so far
He's gonna look at the amulet, figure some shit</p>

<p>Wilbur: 9ft tall, smells poor (WHATEVER THAT MEANS), not wearing a hat</p>

<p>Going to mayors: We need a permit
urchin kid: dindu nuffin. DEFINITELY a loser. fuck that kid.
We get a permit BUT ITs A FUGAZI
oh yeah the password to the boarded up place is NOT "FUCK"</p>

<p>OK Try again tomorrow- Matay decides to "go to town" (aka fuck or w/e)</p>

<p>Next day we go to the same guards and hand them the same ticket LIKE THATS GONNA WORK FUCK</p>

<p>Valmyr or whatever magic shit puts them together and I "suggest" that the other guards on the west gate let us in</p>

<p>Also matay saves his own skin by giving the other guard a quickie</p>

<p>we walk in, i smooth talk some more, we see the mayor, he tells us to go to some bumfuck town down the river (portsmouth? pottymouth? idk)</p>

<p>Then he shoos us out so he can talk to the shadow goverment (LITERALLY FUCKING SHADOWS) and forces us into the sewers where MORE FUCKING CULTISTS? SERIOUSLY</p>

<p>Matay saw something that made him cry, but he still did ok against the cultists. Dave and Ulfjizz made stew with their weapons. I hope the Health &amp; Safety guys don't come down here.</p>

<p>We ended up outside the city gates in the end. We will have to decide whether to go back in or head down the river. I literally don't care, they will still find me. </p>
