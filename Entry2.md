# Memoir notes
## Entry Number 2

Recap:
We got fucked in a library and met whats his dick (armititfdse) and then got attacked by cultists while going to see some other dood

Loot:
Wooden amulet tied with twine with blackened burned in image of a sheep.

Professor Die-er: came back half-crazed with a grad student. maybe the fucked.
He's a geologist, doesnt SEEM to know anything. he's holding shit back


Wilmarth: Prof, dept of history He could tell us more about this amulet thingy. Or not. we've had bad luck so far
He's gonna look at the amulet, figure some shit


Wilbur: 9ft tall, smells poor, not wearing a hat


Going to mayors: We need a permit
urchin kid: DEFINITELY a loser. fuck that kid.
We get a permit BUT ITs A FUGAZI
oh yeah the password to the boarded up place is NOT "FUCK"

OK Try again tomorrow- Matay decides to "go to town" (aka fuck or w/e)


Next day we go to the same guards and hand them the same ticket LIKE THATS GONNA WORK FUCK

Valmyr or whatever magic shit puts them together and I "suggest" that the other guards on the west gate let us in

Also matay saves his own skin by giving the other guard a quickie

we walk in, i smooth talk some more, we see the mayor, he tells us to go to some bumfuck town down the river (portsmouth? pottymouth? idk)

Then he shoos us out so he can talk to the shadow goverment (LITERALLY FUCKING SHADOWS) and forces us into the sewers where MORE FUCKING CULTISTS? SERIOUSLY

Matay saw something that made him cry, but he still did ok against the cultists. Dave and Ulfjizz made stew with their weapons. I hope the Health & Safety guys don't come down here.

We ended up outside the city gates in the end. We will have to decide whether to go back in or head down the river. I literally don't care, they will still find me.
